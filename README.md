## Archived project

The original DAQ project was developed in Python for the Raspberry Pi 4. Due to supply shortages, the project switched to an ESP32 microcontroller. The codebase for the original project can be found in this branch: https://github.com/sfuphantom/DAQ/tree/RaspberryPi-Archive-2021
