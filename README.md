# Network  
A Network subteam repository for Team Phantom, which currently involves CAN and simulation development

## Structure
As the network subteam involves creating drivers for multiple subsystems of the car, which will have differing frameworks and languages, the repository will be divided into branches of related systems.

For now, the `main` branch will serve as the README, unless a more centralized use case is needed. And extra `release/dev` branches can be created for the same system once further in development. 

The current branch structure of the repository is as follows:

    --Main
      --CAN-Drivers
        |--CAN-DAQ-dev
        |--CAN-Dashboard-dev
        |--CAN-VCU-dev
        |--CAN-BMS-dev
      --Other Branches (simulation etc. - Section not final)
        |--Sim-DAQ-dev
